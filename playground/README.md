# NanoCore Playground

Interactive web-based IDE for the NanoCore Assembly VM.

## Features

- üé® **Monaco Editor** - Full-featured code editor with syntax highlighting
- ‚ö° **Real-time Execution** - Step through code and watch registers update
- üìä **Performance Monitoring** - Track IPC, cache hits, and more
- üîç **Memory Inspector** - View and modify VM memory
- üìö **Example Programs** - Learn with pre-built demos
- üöÄ **WASM-powered** - Near-native performance in the browser

## Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Architecture

The playground consists of:

1. **React Frontend** - Modern UI with real-time updates
2. **TypeScript VM** - Simulated VM for demonstration
3. **Monaco Editor** - VS Code's editor for the web
4. **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling

In production, the TypeScript VM would be replaced with the actual NanoCore WASM module compiled from the assembly implementation.
